About time I learn how to use it

Hello, other GitHub users,

My name is Guilherme Hunter Monteiro (hence the longin). I ambition to be ruler of the universe when I finish my programming and jedai trainings. I go to a place I can't talk about (it's the rules) when i'm stressed and I gotta say, the bruises are worth it.
